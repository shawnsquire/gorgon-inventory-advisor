# Gorgon Inventory Advisor - Todo

## Feature Ideas

- [ ] **Sell vs. Craft Analysis** — When the engine recommends SELL for raw materials, check if crafting them into something else would be more valuable or worth the crafting XP. E.g., should I sell the oak logs or turn them into oak chips for a future recipe?

- [ ] **Inventory Organization Manager** — Recommend where to store items to keep similar categories grouped together in storage locations, organized by price or type.

- [ ] **NPC Vendor / "Sell To" Display** — Show which NPCs will buy an item (not just gift preferences), with a toggle for NPCs the player hasn't met yet.

- [ ] **Gift Cooldown Tracking** — Track per-NPC gifting cooldowns. Deferred since the app doesn't have real-time game data.
